      CGILua allows the separation of logic and data handling from the
      generation of pages, making it easy to develop web applications with
      Lua. CGILua can be used with a variety of Web servers and, for each
      server, with different launchers. A launcher is responsible for the
      interaction of CGILua and the Web server, for example using ISAPI on
      IIS or mod_lua on Apache.
