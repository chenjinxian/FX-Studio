1.2     2012-07-13

 * Fix build problem with libtool (requires compiler to be called 'gcc',
   not 'cc').
 * Remove support for building Windows DLL.
 * Upgrade included version of Lunit test system to version 0.5.

1.1     2008-04-19

 * Warning: this release changes the behaviour of the 'close' and 'size'
   methods in a way which is not backwards compatible with version 1.0,
   although these small changes are unlikely to affect real code.
 * The 'close' method now does the same as 'size(0)', so it can be used
   to free the buffer associated with a memoryfile object.  This is so that
   code which relies on 'close' freeing up resources can be used with
   memoryfile objects as well as real file handles.
 * The 'size' method now returns the old size, before the method began,
   rather than the new size after it has been changed.  This will only
   affect code which uses a single call to 'size' to both get and set the
   size.  The change is to bring this method into line with accessors in
   my other libraries.
 * Impose minimum size on buffer to avoid excessive reallocation.
 * The version number is no longer included in the userdata metatable
   name in the Lua registry, so for all future versions the file handles
   will have the same metatable name.  This makes it possible, although not
   necessarily recommended, for C code to directly manipulate these objects.
 * Switch test suite from Lunit 0.3 to Lunit 0.4alpha.

1.0     2007-09-21

 * Initial release.
