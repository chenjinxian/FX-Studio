Lua-memoryfile allows you to manipulate strings in memory as if they were
files.  It can be used to create strings from many parts (like a
stringbuffer), or to read strings a line at a time, or to simulate real files.

When you unpack the source code everything should already be ready for
compilation.  Doing "make install" as root will compile everything, and
install the compiled library and a man page describing it.

See lua-memoryfile(3) for information about how to use the library.  The
same documentation is available on the website, where you can also get the
latest packages:
