* Installation Steps
--------------------

* Using the binary distribution
-------------------------------

  LuaCOM is available in binary form as part of
  Lua for Windows: http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/ .
  This is the easiest way to start using LuaCOM.

* Installing from LuaRocks (from source or maybe binary)
----------------------------------------------------------

  1. Install LuaRocks (www.luarocks.org).
  2. Do "luarocks install luacom".
  
* Installing from LuaDist (from source or maybe binary)
-------------------------------------------------------

  1. Install LuaDist (www.luadist.org).
  2. Do "luadist install luacom".

* Installing from source (without LuaRocks or LuaDist)
------------------------------------------------------

  If installing from source, it's recommented to use the CMake build:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
      
    cmake --build . --target test              (optionally run tests)
                                  (replace "test" with "RUN_TESTS" in Visual Studio)

  What you get:

    * the luacom DLL (luacom.dll)
    * the luacom library (luacom.lib)
    * include files in ./include

  These are the only directories you need for development.

  There are also some older build files (GNU make, nmake, vcproj, and tecmake)
  but they are not as well maintained.

* Installing from source via nmake
----------------------------------

  1. Make sure that Lua is installed in your system.
  2. Edit the Makefile file to suit your environment.
     (in general, you only need to specify where Lua is installed)
  3. Run "nmake" from the luacom directory.
