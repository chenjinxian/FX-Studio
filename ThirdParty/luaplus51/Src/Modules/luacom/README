* What is LuaCOM?
-----------------

  LuaCOM is an add-on library to the Lua language <http://www.lua.org>
  that allows Lua programs to use and implement objects that follow
  the Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) specification and
  the ActiveX technology for property access and method calls.

  LuaCOM is implemented as a C++ library, and can be statically linked to
  an application or loaded at runtime. LuaCOM is provided with its source code
  and the makefiles required to build it.
