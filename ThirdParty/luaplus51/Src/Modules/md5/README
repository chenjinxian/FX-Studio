This is a message digest library for Lua 5.2. It is based on the digest routines
provided by OpenSSL. The library can be built to compute the following digests:
md2, md4, md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, ripemd160, mdc2.
For more information on these digests, see
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD2_(cryptography)
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD4
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD-160
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDC2

OpenSSL is available at
	http://www.openssl.org/
If you're running Unix, you probably already have OpenSSL installed.

If you have trouble finding C source code for MD5 or SHA1 digests that
does not depend on OpenSSL, please send me a note.

To try the library, edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and
then run make. This will build the library and run a simple test.
For detailed installation instructions, see
	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive; see the summary
below. Read also test.lua, which shows the library in action.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
