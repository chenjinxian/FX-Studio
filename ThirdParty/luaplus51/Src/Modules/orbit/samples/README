This folder contains several sample Orbit applications, from trivial
to quite sophisticated:

hello       The traditional "Hello World"
songs       A simple song list formatted with Cosmo
todo        An AJAX todo list, using both straight Orbit (todo.ws)
            and Orbit Pages (todo.op)
pages       Simple Orbit Pages examples
blog        A simple blog with comments
toycms      A simple CMS with posts, categories, moderated comments,
            and an admin interface

It also has a op.ws Orbit pages launcher that can be used to
launch .op files without having this extension configured in
your web server. For example, if you put op.ws in your document
root and go to http://server/op.ws/foo/bar.op op.ws will look
for a file foo/bar.op in your document root and process it using
Orbit Pages.
