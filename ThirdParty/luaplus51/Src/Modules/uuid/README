This is a uuid library for Lua 5.2. It generates Universally Unique Identifiers
using libuuid, which is part of the e2fsprogs package and is available at
	http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/
If you're running Linux, libuuid is probably already installed.

To try the library, just edit Makefile to reflect your installation of Lua and
possibily of libuuid. Then run make. This will build the library and run a
simple test. For detailed installation instructions, see
	http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/lua/install.html

There is no manual but the library is simple and intuitive; see the summary
below. Read also test.lua, which shows the library in action.

This code is hereby placed in the public domain.
Please send comments, suggestions, and bug reports to lhf@tecgraf.puc-rio.br .
