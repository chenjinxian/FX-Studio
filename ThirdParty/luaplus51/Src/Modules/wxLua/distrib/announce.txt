Announcing wxLua 2.8.0.0: lua bindings to wxWidgets
----------------------------------------------------------------

The wxLua team is pleased to announce a new release of the lua bindings to wxWidgets cross-platform GUI library. This version supports wxWidgets 2.6.3 to 2.8.0 and uses lua 5.1.

wxLua is a lua scripting language wrapper around the C++ wxWidgets cross-platform GUI library. It consists of an executable for running standalone wxLua scripts, a module for lua programs to load using require, and the source code to build a library for extending C++ programs with a fast, small, fully embeddable scripting language.

wxWidgets is a cross-platform toolkit that lets developers create applications for Win32, Mac OS X, GTK+, X11, Motif, WinCE, and more using a single codebase. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets applications look and feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses the platform's own native controls rather than emulating them. It's also extensive, free, open-source, and mature.

wxLua wraps all the GUI controls that wxWidgets provides as well as common dialogs, drawing graphics, image loading, saving, manipulating, file functions, sound and media playback, printing, sockets, and more.
