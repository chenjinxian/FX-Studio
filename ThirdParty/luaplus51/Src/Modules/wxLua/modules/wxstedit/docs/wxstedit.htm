<h2>Overview :</h2>

The
wxStEditor is a library and sample program for the wxWidgets's
wxStyledTextCtrl wrapper around the Scintilla text editor widget. This
program is meant to be a demonstration of the wxStEdit library and has
turned out to be a fairly capable syntax highlighting text editor with
a number of advanced features.<br>

<br>

What does the ST
in wxStEditor stand for? Either styled text or Scintilla text, your
choice.<br>

<br>

The core for the editor was originally
based on Otto Wyss's wxGuide editor.<br>

need to put double quotes (") around your filenames.</li>

options from the given file, if no file is given then do not load the
configuration at all.</li>

<h2>Splitting Editors</h2>

The
editors can be split vertically or horizontally to view two parts of
the same document at once. You can edit in either part. There are menu
items to do this in the "Window" menu or you can use the splitter
buttons located on top of the vertical scrollbar or on the right of the
horizontal scrollbar. To unsplit the editor just drag the splitter bar
to the side so that that editor in the position you want to save takes
the full window.
<h2>Notebook</h2>

The notebook menu is
accessed by right clicking the mouse on the notebook tabs. The items in
this menu are fairly straightforward, please review the "Menu Items"
section for details.<br>

<br>

You can close a notebook
page quickly by middle clicking on the tab you want to close.
<h2>Menu
Items :</h2>

Help is also given for the menu items in the
statusbar. Note that menu items that end with "..." will popup a dialog
which you can cancel to not take any action.<br>

    <li>Save preferences : Save the currently selected

    <li>This editor supports syntax highlighting for a
number of different programming languages. In order to make it easy to
create your own color and style theme, a single generic list of styles
is used. This is because some languages have rather esoteric idioms and
if this editor catered to each and every one there would be hundreds of
different styles to have to adjust. The list tries to encompass most of
the common styles for all the language lexers (code parsers).
Therefore, the names given to the styles are meant only as hints as to
what the style will be used for and you can map any editor style to any
lexer style. For more information you should examine the "Languages"
tab where you can change the mapping of the editor and lexer styles.<br>

    </li>

    <li>Select the style you want to change by clicking on the
margin
or double clicking the line. You can change the individual attributes
for a style by checking the checkboxes to the left or uncheck them to
use the attribute value from the "Default Style" in the "Lexer Styles".
It is a good idea to set the "Default Style" first so that you only set
the values for the other styles that you want to be different.
Attributes that do not apply for specific styles are disabled.<br>

    </li>

    <li>The "Editor Colors" page allows you to change the
overall
appearance of the editor for any language.</li>

    <li>The
"Lexer Styles" page shows a list of styles to allow you to adjust them
all at once to easily create a theme that'll look good for any
language. You can also select particular languages to see what styles
they use and get a feel for what they would look like. The styles that
are used for the currently set lexer in the "Languages" tab are shown
with a white cross in the margin.</li>

    <h3>Languages</h3>

  </li>

  <ul>

    <li>Language : Choose a language to highlight the
current document with.</li>

    <li>File patterns : A
semicolon ';' separated list of file patterns to use to detect what
language to use for that type of file.</li>

    <ul>

      <li>Example : "*.c;*.cpp;*.h" for C/C++ will treat
any file name that ends with .c, .cpp, or .h as a C/C++ file.</li>

    </ul>

    <li>This editor supports syntax
highlighting for a number of different programming languages. Choose
the language lexer you want to use for the current document using the
"Language" choice control. The file patterns are a semicolon ';'
separated list of file patterns to detect what language to use for
different file types. For example; C/C++ has the patterns
'*.c;*.cpp;*.h' which means that files ending with .c, .cpp, .h will be
lexed using C/C++ programming language.<br>

    </li>

    <li>The
"Styles" tab allows you to change the mapping between the editor styles
on the left and the lexer styles on the right. See the overall "Styles"
tab to adjust the look of the editor styles and to learn about the
names given to the editor styles. Use the "Choose style" choice control
to select a different editor style, note that the names of the editor
styles are just hints for what they're most used for and can be
arbitrarily mapped to any lexer style. Select a different lexer style
to modify by clicking on the margin or double clicking on the
appropriate line.<br>

    </li>

    <li>The "Keywords" tab
allows you to view the special keywords for the language. Different
languages may have different numbers of keyword sets and each one can
be given their own styling. You may add your own additional keywords by
entering them as a space separated list into the "Additional keywords"
text control.</li>
